# **_My Experience With Bloc_**
#### My  experience at Bloc in short has been amazing so far . right off the bat i started making connections on the Blocs slack , these connections not only help you learn but also help you revise your current skillset , i was met with complete strangers that not only  took the time out of their busy day to help a beginner programmer like myself they also  helped make sure you understood the solution and how to go about problem solving . The first meeting i had with my mentor is what set the bar for the future , he helped guide me to the solution  instead of just giving me the answer ,which bolstered my problem solving skills . My mentor did exercises with me every meeting we had gave me valuable input on how to look for help when dealing with a programming problem , he identified my problems and helped me work on them every meeting , but if i ever needed help when a meeting was not scheduled or too far away , i sent my mentor a quick email and got a response within hours which was helpful in keeping me on the move and not stagnant. Bloc has provided me with the structure needed to learn the skills necessary to accomplish my goals as a Full stack developer . Bloc does a really good job of making sure they get feedback so they can update the curriculum as needed aside from the checkpoint feedback button after every checkpoint my mentor took notes of any grievances i had if i had any  but  with all the updates to the curriculum they usually keep up with keeping the curriculum current and fresh and any small grievance that you have is usually gone by the end of the week if it isnâ€™t solved or explained by your mentor .
