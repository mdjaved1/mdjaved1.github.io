# **_Challenges Faced While Learning to develop_**
## remembering all syntax and methods:
*  ### While writing functions in  code wars challenges , there are so many ways to do that one thing , which makes it very frustrating in finding out what way is the best and how can i learn all the other ways and methods on how to go about writing that function which the other people have used in the solutions .

##  Jack of all trades master of none :
* ### With learning to develop you will need to learn alot of different languages and develop within alot of different frameworks . one of the more difficult challenges i have had to face is not letting curiosity get the better of me and diving into too much too fast .

##  Frustration and being stuck  is a rite of passage in development :
*  ### Learning that frustration on being stuck on a problem is ok was a great milestone for me , as i did not know how to deal with it efficiently , my mentor recommended stepping back for 10 to 15 minutes and coming back to a problem gives you a fresh perspective which has helped me in solving the majority of my hard problems  and  the feeling you get after you solve a problem that you have been working on a while is like no other feeling in the world

## Google is your best friend
*  ### Learning to Forage for solutions is a crucial skill in development and i have had to learn that the hard way , foraging was a weakness that i started out with that has become a strength now , resources like stack overflow and devdocs are a huge help when coding .
